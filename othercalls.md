Calls for Tutorials, Vendor Presentations, Exhibitors & Sponsors

## Call for Tutorials

At the Modelica conference, several tutorials will take place in parallel. Each tutorial will last for up to 3 hours and includes a "hands-on-experience" session (participants are expected to have own notebook; the presenter will provide the presented tools). If you are interested, please file in the  [Vendor Session/Tutorial Application Form](Documents/VendorSessionTutorial.pdf), providing title, presenter(s), and an abstract of the tutorial. Please send your application to  [modelica2021@groups.liu.se](mailto:modelica2021@groups.liu.se?subject=Vendor%20Session%2FTutorial%20application%20form). The deadline for application is  **August 1st, 2021**; however, as only a limited number of tutorials can be held in parallel (up to 6), we advise you to apply as early as possible.

Tutorials are free for the participants, but especially for commercial tools the presenter is charged 250 € per session, provided it is a hands on training tutorial, not just commercial presentation or demonstration (for product presentations see Vendor sessions above). Upon written request some tutorials, especially non-commercial, (e.g. FMI, Open Source libraries etc.), could be exempted from the fee by decision of the organising committee.

Decision about the acceptance of tutorials will be based upon Modelica/FMI relation of content and on the time of application.

You will be contacted by the organizers' financial department and receive a bill covering the tutorial fee.

## Call for Vendor Presentations

Do you want to inform the attendees about your new product? You can demonstrate your tools live and provide latest information on features. Since only a limited number of vendor presentations can be held (Maximum of 18 slots in 6 parallel sessions during Monday Afternoon), please contact us as soon as possible via the  [Vendor Session/Tutorial application form](Documents/VendorSessionTutorial.pdf), providing title, presenter(s), and an abstract of the presentation. Please send your application to  [modelica2021@groups.liu.se](mailto:modelica2021@groups.liu.se?subject=Vendor%20Session%2FTutorial%20application%20form). Decision about the acceptance of vendor presentations will be based upon Modelica/FMI relation of content and on the time of application.

The attendees would be asked in advance, which session they prefer to attend to sort the sessions accordingly. Vendor sessions takes place in conference venue, in room with up to 100 attendees, with available projector screen and sound. Session length is 45 minutes and the price is 500 € per one session. If appropriate, one company could reserve more sessions (e.g. for different products).

All items are limited, based on first-come-first-served basis, except for Platinum and Gold sponsors, who have time-limited priority. Do not hesitate to contact us for any special needs. The deadline for application is  **August 1st, 2021**.

You will be contacted by the organizers' financial department and receive a bill covering the vendor session fee.

## Call for Exhibitors & Sponsors

A commercial exhibition will be arranged in conjunction to the conference. The commercial exhibition will be an excellent exhibition window towards the expected 400 delegates. Developers and vendors have the opportunity to present their Modelica- and/or FMI-related products and services, like:

-   Modeling simulation and design tools
-   Modelica libraries
-   Consulting and engineering services with Modelica and/or FMI.

Decision about the acceptance of exhibitors will be based upon Modelica/FMI relevance of products and/or services and on the time of application submission.

The exhibition will be open from Monday noon (start of tutorials section) and continue during conference hours until the end of conference on Wednesday. Preparation of exhibition can start on Monday morning.
During nighttime the premises would be guarded and there will be a possibility to lock up the valuables.

For online participants, the vendors can choose to stream a pre-registered video in the virtual conference rooms during break times or to live stream from the vendor booths for Q&A sessions.
