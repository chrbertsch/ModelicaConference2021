# Covid-19 policy

In light of the unprecedented situation with Covid-19, we want all the participants to feel safe.
To this end, it will be possible to convert between virtual and physical attendance until late registrations close (there might be a fee to cover our costs to issue a partial refund; this will be clarified when registration opens).

In the event that Swedish national authorities advise against holding large events next fall,
the conference will be moved completely online and all physical participations shall be converted to virtual ones at no charge (the difference will be refunded).

In any case, all the national guidelines regarding Covid-19 safety will be respected
and as we get closer to the event date and the situation becomes clearer the guidelines will be clarified on the conference page.
