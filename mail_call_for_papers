Title: CALL FOR PAPERS - REMINDER - 14th International Modelica Conference - September 20-24, 2021 - Submission Deadline April 26, 2021 - FREE REGISTRATION


Dear Modelica interested,

Due to the uncertainity regarding travel restrictions in the fall we have made the decision to make the conference fully virtual and we have extended the dates to September 20-14, 2021. This will enable to us to add Industrial User Presentations around different topics such as eFMI, FMI and SSP.

Moreover, we would like to use this as an opportunity to reach out to a wider audience and expand the Modelica community, so we have have decided to make participation free of charge and to finance the conference through sponsorships.

The Modelica Conference will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications. The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to Modelica and to the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI). More information is contained on the conference page:
https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org

For scientific presnetations, you are encouraged to submit a full paper until April 26, 2021. Every submitted paper will be reviewed by 3 reviewers. 
If you would like to submit to an industrial user group session, you are encouraged to submit an abstract until April 26, 2021.

More details about the “call for papers”, “call for libraries”, “call for vendor presentations”, “call for exhibitors”, and “call for tutorials/workshops” is available under: https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/call2021.html

We look forward to seeing you,
